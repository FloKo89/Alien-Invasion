# Alien Invasion

Earth is under threat from an alien invasion. Don't let the invasion units reach Earth and dodge the projectiles from the combat drones.

Can you defeat the leader in level 5 and climb the leaderboard?



This is the first game I have ever programmed. I created it in the Python language and the pygame library in Virtual Studio Code.

I created this game to consolidate what I learned from an online course and to further my education.  

I put emphasis on an object oriented program structure and a clean code, which is easy to maintain and extend.

I hope to give a few people some fun with this little game.

I am very happy about comments.

Now have fun!
